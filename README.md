## ⚡ Quick Start — Unified API

Atlas Cloud provides a single API endpoint for all 106 video models. Just change the `model` parameter to switch between providers.

### cURL

```bash
# Universal API call example - just change the model parameter to switch models
curl -X POST https://api.atlascloud.ai/v1/video/generate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "kling-3.0-pro",
    "prompt": "A beautiful sunset over the ocean, cinematic quality",
    "duration": 10,
    "resolution": "4k",
    "aspect_ratio": "16:9"
  }'
```

### Python

```python
# Atlas Cloud unified video generation SDK
import requests

class AtlasVideoAPI:
    """Atlas Cloud unified video generation API wrapper"""

    BASE_URL = "https://api.atlascloud.ai/v1"

    def __init__(self, api_key: str):
        self.headers = {
            "Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}",
            "Content-Type": "application/json"
        }

    def generate(self, model: str, prompt: str, **kwargs) -> dict:
        """Generate video - supports all 106 models"""
        payload = {
            "model": model,
            "prompt": prompt,
            **kwargs
        }
        response = requests.post(
            f"{self.BASE_URL}/video/generate",
            json=payload,
            headers=self.headers
        )
        return response.json()

    def get_status(self, task_id: str) -> dict:
        """Query video generation status"""
        response = requests.get(
            f"{self.BASE_URL}/video/status/{task_id}",
            headers=self.headers
        )
        return response.json()

# Usage example
api = AtlasVideoAPI("YOUR_API_KEY")

# Generate 4K video with Kling 3.0 Pro
result = api.generate(
    model="kling-3.0-pro",
    prompt="Cinematic ocean sunset with dramatic clouds",
    duration=10,
    resolution="4k"
)

# Switch to Wan 2.6 (cheaper) - just change the model parameter
result = api.generate(
    model="wan-2.6",
    prompt="Cinematic ocean sunset with dramatic clouds",
    duration=10,
    resolution="1080p"
)

# Use Seedance v1.5 (with audio)
result = api.generate(
    model="seedance-v1.5-pro",
    prompt="Cinematic ocean sunset with dramatic clouds",
    duration=10,
    resolution="1080p",
    audio=True
)
```

### JavaScript / Node.js

```javascript
// Atlas Cloud unified video generation API - Node.js example
class AtlasVideoAPI {
  constructor(apiKey) {
    this.baseUrl = 'https://api.atlascloud.ai/v1';
    this.headers = {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    };
  }

  // Generate video - supports all 106 models
  async generate(model, prompt, options = {}) {
    const response = await fetch(`${this.baseUrl}/video/generate`, {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: this.headers,
      body: JSON.stringify({ model, prompt, ...options })
    });
    return response.json();
  }

  // Query generation status
  async getStatus(taskId) {
    const response = await fetch(
      `${this.baseUrl}/video/status/${taskId}`,
      { headers: this.headers }
    );
    return response.json();
  }
}

// Usage example
const api = new AtlasVideoAPI('YOUR_API_KEY');

// Same API, different models - just change the model parameter
const models = ['kling-3.0-pro', 'seedance-v1.5-pro', 'wan-2.6', 'veo-3.1'];

for (const model of models) {
  const result = await api.generate(model, 'A beautiful sunset over mountains', {
    duration: 10,
    resolution: '1080p'
  });
  console.log(`${model}:`, result);
}
```

## 🎨 Prompt Engineering Master Guide

### Universal Tips (Work Across All Models)

1. **Structure your prompt:** `[Subject] + [Action] + [Setting] + [Style] + [Camera] + [Lighting] + [Technical]`

2. **Be specific about motion:** Instead of "a bird flying," say "a red cardinal gliding gracefully through falling autumn leaves, wings fully extended"

3. **Specify camera movement:** Use professional cinematography terms for best results

4. **Include lighting descriptions:** "golden hour backlighting," "dramatic chiaroscuro," "soft diffused studio light"

5. **Reference real-world styles:** "shot on ARRI Alexa," "Christopher Nolan style," "National Geographic quality"

### Camera Movement Vocabulary

| Term | Description | Best For |
|:-----|:-----------|:---------|
| `dolly in/out` | Camera moves toward/away from subject | Dramatic reveals |
| `tracking shot` | Camera follows subject laterally | Action sequences |
| `crane shot` | Camera rises/lowers vertically | Establishing shots |
| `orbit/arc` | Camera circles around subject | Product showcases |
| `steadicam` | Smooth handheld following movement | Documentary feel |
| `whip pan` | Fast horizontal rotation | Transitions |
| `push in` | Slow deliberate zoom toward subject | Emotional moments |
| `pull out` | Camera retreats from subject | Reveals |
| `dutch angle` | Tilted camera angle | Tension, unease |
| `bird's eye` | Directly overhead | Patterns, layouts |
| `worm's eye` | Ground-level looking up | Power, scale |
| `rack focus` | Focus shifts between planes | Drawing attention |

### Model-Specific Keywords

**Kling** responds well to:
- `"cinematic"`, `"4K"`, `"60fps"`, `"anamorphic"`, `"multi-shot"`
- `"IMAX quality"`, `"film grain"`, `"color graded"`

**Seedance** responds well to:
- `"synchronized audio"`, `"camera orbit"`, `"narrative"`
- `"sound design"`, `"foley"`, `"musical rhythm"`

**Wan** responds well to:
- `"anime style"`, `"watercolor"`, `"illustration"`
- `"Ghibli"`, `"Pixar"`, `"artistic rendering"`

**Veo** responds well to:
- `"physically accurate"`, `"realistic physics"`, `"natural motion"`
- `"documentary"`, `"BBC Earth"`, `"scientific accuracy"`

**Hailuo** responds well to:
- `"aesthetic"`, `"trendy"`, `"Instagram"`, `"viral"`
- `"satisfying"`, `"ASMR"`, `"pleasing"`

**Vidu** responds well to:
- `"transition"`, `"morph"`, `"transform"`
- `"interpolation"`, `"seamless"`, `"smooth transition"`

### Aspect Ratio Guide

| Ratio | Resolution | Best For |
|:------|:-----------|:---------|
| 16:9 | 1920x1080 / 3840x2160 | YouTube, Film, TV |
| 9:16 | 1080x1920 | TikTok, Reels, Shorts |
| 1:1 | 1080x1080 | Instagram Posts |
| 4:5 | 1080x1350 | Instagram Feed |
| 21:9 | 2560x1080 | Ultrawide, Cinematic |

### Audio Generation Tips

For models that support native audio (Kling 3.0, Seedance v1.5, Wan 2.6, Veo 3, Hailuo 2.3):

- **Describe ambient sounds:** `"with sounds of ocean waves crashing"`, `"birds chirping in background"`
- **Specify music mood:** `"upbeat electronic music"`, `"melancholic piano accompaniment"`
- **Include dialogue hints:** `"character speaking excitedly"`, `"whispering narration"`
- **Sound effects:** `"thunderclap"`, `"footsteps on gravel"`, `"engine roar"`
